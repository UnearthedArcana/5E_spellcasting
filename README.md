<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod will allow all Vancian spellcasters in the game to instead use 5E-style "semi-spontaneous" spellcasting. In the 1E/2E/3E system you have "spell slots," each of which allows you to memorize and cast a particular spell. In this system, memorization slots are divorced from casting slots. You can prepare a certain number of spells each day (the number of memorization slots for each spell level); and then you get a certain number of slots that you can use to cast any of those prepared spells.</p>
  <p>In-game, you will have an innate ability that gives you acces to your spellbook and memorization slots. You fill those slots and then sleep. Upon waking, you will be able to cast those memorized spells spontaneously - just like a sorcerer does. At this point you will not have access to the memorization slots in your spellbook. To change your memorized spells, you must again use the "Change Prepared Spells" innate ability. NOTE: after using that ability, you will not be able to cast ANY spells! Getting access to your memorization slots disables your casting slots. Only after resting do you get your casting slots back (refreshed).</p>
  <p>This does not change sorcerers at all. If you think this makes mages more powerful relative to sorcerers, you're not wrong. They will still not ba a match at any given moment, however (sorcerers still get more casting slots). And if you install the "Spell Switching" component of Tome & Blood then sorcerers get a bit of added flexibility as well.</p>
  <p>A consequence of how this system works is, each item that give you bonus spell slots can only give you +1 casting slot for each spell level. So something like the Ring of Acuity, which normally gives you +2 2nd-level slots and +1 3rd level slot, will instead only give you +1 2nd-level slot and +1 3rd-level slot. There are various mods that add such items, and people play the game in various different languages, so I am not even going to try to patch the item descriptions. If you are wearing an item that gives you multiple bonus slots (hi Evermemory!) and you are only getting one... this is why. (Sorcerers can still get the full bonus from such items, however.)</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> this mod makes heavy use of the EE 2.0+ engine features. I would not even try to install this on a game version lower than 2.5.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have a "5E_spellcasting" folder and "setup-5E_spellcasting.exe" in your game folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-5E_spellcasting.exe" and then follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>MacOS:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with the Mac Weidu Launcher (MWL). To install, simply extract the contents of the mod and then move them into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should now have a folder called "5E_spellcasting" and the "Mac WeiDU Launcher" in your game directory. To install, simply double-click the MWL, choose "5E_spellcasting" from the list, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod should be installed after spell mods like Spell Revisions, IWDification, and SCS IWD Spells. It should probably be installed before Might & Guile; the MnG Bard kits will probably want this system in place before you install them.</p>
